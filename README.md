# TFT_eFX

A template library that allows extra graphics function to be added to the TFT_eSPI library.

This library will be expaned over time to add new graphics capabilities to the library, this may include gauges, dials,
progress bars, graph drawing etc.

At the moment the library includes functions for drawing bezier curves by defining a set of 3 points. The example demonstrates 
the drawing of thr curves.

If you fork this library and add new functions plus a commented example, then do create a pull request.
