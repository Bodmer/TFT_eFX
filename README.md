# TFT_eFX

A template graphics extension library for TFT_eSPI.

Extra graphics functions can be added to this library to suit you projects. At the moment it has a function to draw curves and a simple 
myGraphicsFunction(x, y, color) example function that draws a 3x3 pixel block of the specified color centered on x,y

See the TFT_eFX_Your_Function example to get the general idea.

Use as a template when you add your graphics functions to the libraries files:

	TFT_eFX.h     - add function prototype, see myGraphicsFunction() line
	TFT_eFX.cpp   - add function with code, see myGraphicsFunction() lines
	keywords.txt  - add function name to highlight in IDE, see myGraphicsFunction line

If you have a Github acount you can create a pull request for possible inclusion of your graphics functions to the master library. The caveat is that functions should be of general appeal to other users and an example should be added to the examples folder.

Potentially this library could be adapted to work with other graphics libraries.

Enjoy!
